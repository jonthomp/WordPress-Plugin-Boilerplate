# Extended WordPress Plugin Boilerplate with Namespace and Autoloader Support Plus ES6, React and SCSS

This is a fork of the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate with Namespace and Autoloader support](https://github.com/karannagupta/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project, which itself is a fork of the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate). This version includes support for modern javascript functionality including ES6 and React along with extended PHP boilerplate for additional features such as shortcodes and custom post types.

This project will also include some additional build tools for preparing your plugin for submission including automating the renaming process mentioned in the below installation instructions.

## Contents

The `wp-plugin-name` directory contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

- Build all plugin UI components with React and SCSS.
- Examples of custom shortcodes, post types, settings pages, content editor buttons and post meta boxes
- The Boilerplate is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
- All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.
- The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that corresponds both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that makes it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
- The project includes a `.pot` file as a starting point for internationalization.

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs.

- Copy wp-plugin-name to your plugin's directory and rename it to your plugin's name
- Perform a find and replace at the project level as follows:
  1.  Find the text `wp-plugin-name` and replace with `your-plugin-name` in all files
  2.  Find the text `WP_Plugin_Name` and replace with `Your_Plugin_Name` in all files
  3.  Rename the `scss` and `js` files under `assets\src\js`, `assets\src\scss` and replace the string `wp-plugin-name` with `your-plugin-name`
  4.  Rename the `pot` file under `languages` and replace the string `wp-plugin-name` with `your-plugin-name`
  5.  Find the text `http://example.com` and replace with your URI in all files
  6.  Find the text `Your Name or Your Company` and replace with your name in all files
- Activate the plugin

#### Quick Commands to perform the Find and Replace

```bash
# After having downloaded and extracted the archive, navigate to the folder containing the plugin
$ mv wp-plugin-name my-awesome-plugin
$ cd my-awesome-plugin
```

```bash
# Replace text for "example.com/wp-plugin-name-uri" and "example.com"
$ grep -rl "example.com/wp-plugin-name-uri" ./* | xargs sed -i "s/example.com\/wp-plugin-name-uri/somedomain.com\/my-awesome-plugin-uri/g"

$ grep -rl "example.com" ./* | xargs sed -i "s/example.com/somedomain.com/g"
```

```bash
# Replace text for "wp-plugin-name"
$ grep -rl "wp-plugin-name" ./* | xargs sed -i "s/wp-plugin-name/my-awesome-plugin/g"
```

```bash
# Replace text for "wp_plugin_name"
$ grep -rl "wp_plugin_name" ./* | xargs sed -i "s/wp_plugin_name/my_awesome_plugin/g"
```

```bash
# Replace Namespace references for the text "WP_Plugin_Name"
$ grep -rl "WP_Plugin_Name" ./* | xargs sed -i "s/WP_Plugin_Name/My_Awesome_Plugin/g"
```

```bash
# Rename Files with the text "wp-plugin-name" in them
$ find . -iname '*wp-plugin-name*' -exec rename 's/wp-plugin-name/my-awesome-plugin/' {} \;
```

```bash
# Replace text for Your Name
$ grep -rl "Your Name or Your Company" ./* | xargs sed -i "s/Your Name or Your Company/Your Name/g"
```

Note that this will activate the source code of the Boilerplate, but because the Boilerplate has no real functionality there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types added.

### Plugin Structure

### PHP

If you want to include your own classes, or third-party libraries

- `wp-plugin-name/inc/admin` - admin-specific functionality
- `wp-plugin-name/inc/core` - plugin core to register hooks, load files etc
- `wp-plugin-name/inc/frontend` - public-facing functionality
- `wp-plugin-name/inc/common` - functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts
- `wp-plugin-name/inc/libraries` - libraries that the plugin may use

### Javascript and SCSS

- `wp-plugin-name/assets/src/js/wp-plugin-name-admin.js` - admin-specific javascript
- `wp-plugin-name/assets/src/js/wp-plugin-name-frontend.js` - public-facing javascript
- `wp-plugin-name/assets/src/scss/wp-plugin-name-admin.scss` - admin-specific SCSS
- `wp-plugin-name/assets/src/scss/wp-plugin-name-frontend.scss` - public-facing SCSS

### PHP Version

Requires PHP `5.6.0` or greater

# Developer Notes

### Environment Variable

In order to provide development and production build envrionments for Javascript and SCSS the boilerplate includes an environment variable (`$this->environment`). This is used in class-admin.php, class-frontend.php and class-common.php to switch loading assets between the Webpack live-reloading dev server and their built static versions.

### The BoilerPlate uses a variable for the Text Domain

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate uses a **variable** (`$this->plugin_text_domain`) to store the text domain, used when internationalizing strings. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

#### i18n Tools

- [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
- [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
- [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin. However, if you face problems translating the strings with an automated tool/process, replace `$this->plugin_text_domain` with the literal string of your plugin's text domain throughout the plugin.
